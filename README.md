# Sencilla

Sencilla (pronounced sen-si-ya) is a minimal Jekyll theme. It is a stripped-down version of [Minima v2.5.1](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with added support for LaTeX and Tag Index page. I have also redesigned some elements and the color scheme as per my liking. The documentation and a demo site will be added soon. Until then, you can check my personal website [dyfrad.com](https://dyfrad.com) to see how this theme looks and functions. 

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sencilla"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: sencilla
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sencilla

## Usage

Will be added soon.

## Acknowledgements

Sencilla is a fork of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) v2.5.1. I have incorporated the `tags.html` page from [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and the grey color tones from [open-color](https://github.com/yeun/open-color).
