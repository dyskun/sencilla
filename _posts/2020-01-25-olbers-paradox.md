### What is Olbers' Paradox?

The fact that the night sky is dark at visible wavelengths, instead of being uniformly bright with starlight, is known as _Olbers' Paradox_.

### Why is the dark night sky a paradox?

Well, the ancient Egyptians and Greeks were pretty cool with the sky being dark at night. According to them, the stars were just the point sources of light stuck to a dome or sphere.

However, later people accepted Copernican Heliocentrism and that's when it became a paradox.

### What is [Copernican Heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism)?

The relevant points of this Copernican Heliocentrism to the paradox are the following:

*   The distance between the Earth and the Sun is much much smaller than the distance between the Earth and the stars.
    *   We can't see the [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) of the stars by the naked eye as the Earth moves around the Sun.
*   The stars are not attached to a rotating [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere) and can be at different distances from the Sun.

These liberating realizations led Thomas Digges, and other post-Copernican astronomers, to embrace a model in which stars are large glowing spheres, like the Sun, scattered throughout the infinite space.

### What's the problem with that?

If we compute the brightness of the night sky in an infinite universe with this model and the following assumptions,

1.  _n_ is the average number density of stars in the universe.
2.  _L_ is the average [stellar luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity#Stellar_luminosity).
3.  The universe is infinitely big
4.  The universe is infinitely old
5.  The flux of light from a distant source is given by the inverse square law

it comes out to be infinite!

### What could go wrong?

*   **Assumption 1 and 2:** The density _n_ and mean luminosity _L_ of stars are constant throughout the universe.
    *   This might not be true.
    *   Distant stars might be less numerous or less luminous than the nearby stars.
    *   If we are in a clump of stars of finite size, then the absence of stars at large distances will keep the night sky from being bright.
    *   Similarly, if distant stars are sufficiently low in luminosity compared to nearby stars, they won't contribute significantly to the sky brightness.
*   **Assumption 3:** Universe is infinitely large
    *   This might not be true.
    *   Doing calculations by assuming a finite universe leads to finite brightness.
    *   The same result is found if we assume that the universe is infinite in space, but is devoid of stars beyond a distance Rmax.
*   **Assumption 4:** Universe is infinitely old
    *   This is a subtle one compared to the previous assumption.
    *   Since the speed of light is finite, when we look farther out in space, we are looking farther out in time. For example, we see the Sun as it was 8.3 minutes ago and [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) as it was 2.5 million years ago.
    *   Therefore, due to the constraints put by the speed of light, we'll only be getting light from a finite part of the universe.
    *   This result will also be found if the universe is infinitely old, but has only contained stars for a finite time.
*   **Assumption 5:** The flux of light from a distance source is given by the [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law).
    *   The inverse square law would have seemed totally innocuous to Olberts and other nineteenth century astronomers; after all, the inverse square law follows directly from [Euclid's law of geometry](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsPostulates.html).
    *   However, in the twentieth century, Albert Einstein demonstrated that the universe might not obey the laws of Euclidean geometry.
    *   In addition, the inverse square law assumes that the source of light is stationary relative to the observer.
    *   If the universe is systematically expanding or contracting, then the light from distant sources will be [redshifted to lower photon energies or blueshifted to higher energies](http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/redshift.html).

### So what's the solution?

The primary solution to Olbers' Paradox comes from the fact that the universe has a finite age. The stars beyond some finite distance, called the horizon distance ([cosmological horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon)), are invisible to us because their light hasn't had time to reach us yet.
