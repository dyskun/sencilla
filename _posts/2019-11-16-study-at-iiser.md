For the students who want to pursue fundamental science, or in other words, courses like B.Sc., M.Sc., etc, IISERs are one of the best places in India to study science after school. What makes these institutions so good is the research atmosphere that these institutes provide to the students.

### Eligibility Criteria

In the following sections, a brief overview of the rules and regulations of IISER admissions is provided. It is not possible for me to write all the rules mentioned by IISER here on this website. I have mentioned some of the most basic rules and regulations provided by IISER. Therefore, I strongly suggest you refer to the [official website](//www.iiseradmission.in/index.php/pages/eligibility) to see the detailed Eligibility Criteria for getting into IISER if you are seriously considering applying. Also, all the details about eligibility are taken directly from the [official website](//www.iiseradmission.in/index.php/pages/eligibility).

#### IISERs take admissions through three channels

1.  **[Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana](http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/index.htm) (KVPY) channel**
    *   Candidates having a valid KVPY fellowship commencing from the 2020-21 academic session are eligible to apply for admissions.
    *   Additional cut-off criteria for marks obtained in 10+2 board examination is also applicable
2.  **Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Advanced) of the Indian Institutes of Technology**
    *   Candidates in the General category securing a rank within 10000 in the Common Rank List (CRL) of JEE Advanced 2020 are eligible to apply.
    *   For candidates belonging to the reserved category (OBC-NC, SC, ST, PD), their category rank should be within 10000.
3.  **State and Central Boards Channel (SCB)**
    *   Students who have passed 10+2 level with science stream from the Boards mentioned in this [list](https://www.iiseradmission.in/assets/files/2019_cutoff.pdf) are eligible to apply via this channel
    *   Students who have done 10+2 from a Board which is **not** mentioned in this [list](https://www.iiseradmission.in/assets/files/2019_cutoff.pdf)[](https://www.iiseradmission.in/assets/files/2019_cutoff.pdf) are **not** eligible to apply through this channel. They have to apply through KVPY or IIT-Advanced channel.
    *   Students who are applying in year 2020 must have passed 10+2 level in year 2019 or 2020.
    *   Students must have secured minimum marks in their respective boards. To see the list of 2019 cutoffs, click [here](https://www.iiseradmission.in/assets/files/2019_cutoff.pdf)
    *   **Students applying through this channel will have to appear in the IISER Aptitude** **Test (IAT)**

Candidates from any board other than the ones listed in [this](https://www.iiseradmission.in/assets/files/2019_cutoff.pdf) table (of State and Central Boards) can apply only through JEE-Advanced and KVPY channels provided that they also satisfy the eligibility criteria as specified by JEE-Advanced or KVPY, as the case may be.

Such candidates should either bring a certificate from their respective board that they are within top 20 percentile of their board or else cut-off scores for CBSE board will be applied for them.

Additionally, for admission to engineering programs through JEE advanced channel, candidates who have secured 75% marks (GEN/EWS/OBC-NCL) or 65% marks (SC/ST/PwD) in their Class XII (or equivalent) exams are also eligible.
