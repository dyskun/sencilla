A list of currently running and upcoming physics experiments in the field of Astroparticle Physics and Cosmology.

## Cosmology experiments

### CMB experiments
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cosmic_microwave_background_experiments)
* [NASA](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/)

### Weak gravitational lensing experiments
I couldn't find the list of such experiments. I have included the ones I know about.
#### Canada-France-Hawai Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLens)
*   Location - Hawaii
*   Status - Active

#### Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)
*   Location - The Netherlands
*   Status - Active
*   Science goals - dark energy, structure of galaxy halos, evolution of galaxies and clusters, and stellar streams and the Galactic halo.

#### Dark-Energy Survey
*   Location - Chile
*   Status - Active
*   Science goals - Dynamics of the expansion of the universe and growth of large-scale structure.

#### Vera C. Rubin Observatory / Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
*   Location - Chile
*   Status - Under development
*   Science goals - understanding dark matter and dark energy,  hazardous asteroids and the remote solar system,  the transient optical sky, the formation and structure of the Milky Way

#### Euclid
*   Location - Space
*   Status - Under development
*   Science goals - To understand why the universe is accelerating, and to understand the nature of dark energy.

### Line Intensity Mapping experiments.

## Neutrino experiments 
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neutrino_experiments)

## Cosmic Ray experiments 
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic-ray_observatory#Observatories_and_experiments)
* [Cosmic ray / Gamma ray / Neutrino and similar experiments](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/CosmicRay/CosmicRaySites.html)
    * I think the info on this page is not complete. I have worked in the GRAPES-3 experiment and this page doesn't have GRAPES-3 in the list.
